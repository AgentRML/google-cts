/**
 * This is the official ConnectionService for Telecom's CTS App. Since telecom requires that a
 * CS be registered in the AndroidManifest.xml file, we have to have a single implementation
 * of a CS and this is it. To test specific CS behavior, tests will implement their own CS and
 * tell MockConnectionService to forward any method invocations to that test's implementation.
 * This is set up using {@link #setUp} and should be cleaned up before the end of the test using
 * {@link #tearDown}.
